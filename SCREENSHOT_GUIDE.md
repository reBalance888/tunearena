Title: Built an AI Music Battle Platform on Solana - MVP Demo Live

Body:
Hey everyone! I just launched the MVP for Tune Arena - think LMArena but for music + betting.

**What it does:**
- Two AI-generated tracks compete anonymously
- You listen and bet $TUNE tokens on the winner
- After 60 seconds, it reveals which AI made which track
- ELO ratings update based on results

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Solana (Phantom wallet)
- TailwindCSS for that gaming aesthetic

**Current Status:**
This is a functional MVP demo. The UI/UX is done, audio players work, but betting smart contracts aren't live yet. Just showing the concept for now.

Would love your feedback! What features would you want to see?
